# Bolton Bits 🔩

This is my library for experimenting with `boltons`.

If Python were IKEA, `boltons` would be the extra screws and tools you always wish came with the box. It's a collection of pure-Python utilities that should've been in the standard library but weren't. 🤷

Over 200 utilities for strings, dicts, lists, caching, and more. It's lightweight, no dependencies, and pure Python.
